# water-tight-framework

A javascript UI framework based on obscure and recommended-against features of various standards

## initial plans

* no legacy features - the idea is standard, but not recommended - no obvious deprecated tricks
* use named access to refer to DOM elements http://w3c.github.io/html/browsers.html#named-access-on-the-window-object
* use iframes to separate scopes of components
* use a document to contain related components like a sprite sheet, and pass parameters via the URL
